# Add calling to your existing app in two minutesIf you're like me, when you start testing a new SDK or service, you just want o to start building and prototyping straight away. While our SDK is super simple to use, you still have to add your own UI to have a calling app that users will understand. I have a minor investment in a company called iRezQ and I wanted to try out if VoIP calling could help them save some money and add an extra feature on top of the existing functionality. iRezQ is an app that warns you about traffic accidents around you. It detects traffic accidents by using your accelerometer with an algorithm that they developed with some insurance companies. Shameless plug.## Setup I Downloaded the framework [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/462krss0k4ov8x3/SinchCallingUIKit.tar.gz?dl=0) or check out the the github repo [https://github.com/sinch/SinchCallingUIKit]()First, I dropped the framework into my Xcode project as an embedded binary (don't forget to check the **'copy if needed'** box)![embedding the framework](Images/embedded.png)Second, I added the **other linker flags** `-ObjC -Xlinker -lc++` in my targets build settings.The last thing to do, is in the setup I need to add the required frameworks by Sinch; **AudioToolbox**, **AVFoundation** and **Security.framework**. (p.s., if you like this kit, I can make available as an pod so you don't even have to the above steps. Tweet me at [@cjsinch](https://twitter.com/cjsinch).## Initializing SinchThe next thing I need to do is to initialize the **SinchCallingUIKit**. In my project I need to do that in two places. One on app launch if its not the first launch and another right after account creation or login. In this app that's in the **AppDelegate** and a **VerifyCode** controller. ```objectivec- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {	// removed a lot of code for clarity ;)    [[CallingManager sharedManager]     startClientWithKey:@"mykey"     secret:@"mysecret"     userName:[User currentUser] sandbox:YES     launchOptions:launchOptions];    return YES;}```The **[User currentUser]** is an internal object to iRezQ where I keep the currently logged in user info. I added the same line of code to my controller where I verify the user. ## Adding a call In iRezQ, there is a premium feature where you can call and ask for help. Right now the app is sending an alert to the operator that they should call them. I remove that code and add the import to my controller and the following line of code```objectivec[[CallingManager sharedManager] callNumber:@"irezQAlarmnumber"];```That's it. Now I am ready to show this to the product owner, in just a few minutes. And it's good to submit to the app store. We probably wont do it, because we want to have VoIP calling so we can send some extra headers with more meta information about the call. But in just a few minutes we can try out the user flow and potential UI without having to plan a whole sprint. <table><tr><td><img src="Images/irezqstart.PNG"> </td><td><img src="Images/manual.PNG"> </td><td><img src="Images/calling.png"> </td><td><img src="Images/incomming.png"></td><td><img src="Images/incall.png"></tr></table>We are really interested to know how you feel about these kind of libraries, tweet me at [@cjsinch](https://twitter.com/cjsinch) or mail me at [christian@sinch.com](mailto:christian@sinch.com). If there is interest we could put in some more effort in to these and maybe have it as a supported product feature. For now enjoy the open source framework that lets you add calling in 3 minutes.
