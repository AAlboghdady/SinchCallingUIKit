# Introducing UI framework for the Sinch toolkit
If you're like me, when you start testing a new SDK or service, you just want o to start building and prototyping straight away. While our SDK is super simple to use, you still have to add your own UI to have a calling app that users will understand. 

Today we, are making this solution open source and you are free to use it as you wish. If you have any ideas, suggestions or changes, just push your changes here and we can make a fantastic UI kit to start using in your apps.When we started to build this we had the vision that you should be able to write just two lines of code to make an outgoing call with a great UI. 1. One line to start the client  2. One line to make a phone call to any number in the world.I also wanted to have as unobtrusive design on the call screen so that it would not interfere with our own app design. We were really inspired by the native iOS8 look that is both elegant and familiar to many app users. It is worth mentioning that this framework is using **ActiveBackground** connections, so you must set the VoIP background mode and Audio background mode on your main app.You can download the tar from here [https://sinch.com/download/SinchCallingUIKit.tar.gz]() - we need to add here [https://github.com/sinch/SinchCallingUIKit]()or check it out and modify it on github. ## How it looksUsing Sinch, there are only two lines of code needed to make outbound PSTN calls. If you want to support DATA-DATA with background calling, there is one more line of code to use, which you can find in our [docmentation](https://www.sinch.com/docs/ios/user-guide/#calling). When you use the framework, it will give your three screens, very similar to the calling screens on iOS8.<table><tr><td><img src="Images/calling.png"> </td><td><img src="Images/incomming.png"></td><td><img src="Images/incall.png"></tr></table>## Call to a regular phoneIn your app:
1. Download the framework here and add it to you project as an embedded binary (sorry iOS 8 only)2. In your **AppDelegate.m**, make sure you add the following lines of code, along with your key and secret
 ``` -(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {       [[CallingManager sharedManager]        startClientWithKey:@"key"        secret:@"secret"        userName:userName sandbox:YES        launchOptions:launchOptions];    return YES;}```3. In your view controller where you want to make call You probably have a button in a view that you want to enable for calling in that IBAction add the following code``` [[CallingManager sharedManager] callNumber:@"+4600000000020"];```## Add background calling for Data to data callingThe last step to add background calling is to add the following code:```- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification {    [[CallingManager sharedManager] handleLocalNotification:notification];}```  Thatâ€™s it! We are really interested to know how you feel about these kind of libraries.
